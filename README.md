Test driving some new toys:

* Dagger2, a replacement for Guice / Spring DI which claims:
  * Catch all dependency graph errors at compile time (seems to work)
  * No reflection used at all
  * Code autogenerated at compile time is human readable and debuggable (yep, no crazy deep stack and the generated factories read pretty much as i'd write them)
  * Fastest & most efficient DI implementation (certainly leagues ahead of Spring and Guice in my experience here)
  * Verdict... i like it! Yeah i'll be using this again in upcoming projects
* AutoValue, auto generates Value Types (i.e. immutable POJOs)
  * I'm less convinced by this one. It works, but i don't really like the look of the classes and intellij builder plugin
    already makes builder generation a zero effort thing
  * I've demonstrated an attack on the supposedly immutable value types in the enclosed unit test

Also playing with some older toys:

* Cucumber, i love the automatic up-typing from data tables in the feature files
* Experimenting with package by feature again. This time i've gone all in, i have a Repository in the same package as
a service and a model. The cool thing is you can set visibility on all the classes quite restrictively. In package by layer
you end up with every class as public, not so here.
